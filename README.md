# City Data Structures & Algorithms — Static Site

Open `index.html` in this folder to view the homepage. The site is fully static and works offline.

Files:
- `index.html` — Homepage with overview and links to member pages.
- `member1.html`, `member2.html`, `member3.html` — Individual member pages with ~10 business cases each.
- `styles.css` — Shared stylesheet.
- `script.js` — Minimal page interactions.

How to open locally (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
# From the project folder:
Start-Process "index.html"
```

Or open the folder in a browser/IDE and double-click `index.html`.

Notes:
- Images referenced in `index.html` are under `assets/` but are optional. If you want placeholder images, create an `assets` folder and add images named `member1.jpg`, `member2.jpg`, `member3.jpg`.
- Want a zip of the folder? Tell me and I'll prepare it for download.
